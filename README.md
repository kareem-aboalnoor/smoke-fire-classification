# 🔥 Smoke & Fire Classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## 🧠 Description
A Convolutional Neural Network model that classifies video frames into **Normal**, **Smoke**, and **Fire** stages for early fire detection.

This project aims to help detect fire incidents at early stages by monitoring video streams and classifying visible smoke before flames appear.
