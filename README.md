# 🔥 Smoke & Fire Classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## 🧠 Description
A Convolutional Neural Network model that classifies video frames into **Normal**, **Smoke**, and **Fire** stages for early fire detection.

This project aims to help detect fire incidents at early stages by monitoring video streams and classifying visible smoke before flames appear.

## 🚀 Features
- 🧩 Classifies each video frame as `Normal`, `Smoke`, or `Fire`
- 🎥 Works on pre-recorded videos or webcam streams
- ⚡ Real-time frame processing using OpenCV
- 📈 High accuracy after training on labeled fire/smoke datasets
